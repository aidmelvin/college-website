# college-website

I wanted to make this website as a sort of Wikipedia for colleges, where people can search for colleges according to their preferences and also add any colleges that they know of or went to. Also people should be able to edit existing listings for colleges. 

These are all features that will be developed over the following few weeks/months.

This was made in React for the frontend and Node for the backend. Express is the router and MongoDB is the database. 

This website will be published at some point on an actual server, but while it is in early development, I do not want to do that.
